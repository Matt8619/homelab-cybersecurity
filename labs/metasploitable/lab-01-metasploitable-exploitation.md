\# Lab 01 – Metasploitable Exploitation


This lab documents enumeration and exploitation of the Metasploitable2 VM.



# Lab 01 – Metasploitable Exploitation

## Objective
Identify and exploit vulnerabilities on a deliberately vulnerable Linux system (Metasploitable2) to demonstrate enumeration and exploitation techniques.

---

## Environment
- Attacker: Kali Linux
- Target: Metasploitable2
- Tools Used:
  - Nmap
  - Metasploit
  - Netcat

---

## Enumeration

An Nmap scan was performed to identify open ports and services on the target system.

The scan revealed multiple outdated and vulnerable services, indicating a high-risk system configuration.

---

## Exploitation

A known backdoor vulnerability was exploited to gain shell access to the target system.

Access was validated using the `whoami` command, confirming root-level privileges.

---

## Post-Exploitation

(Optional) Documented any other findings or screenshots after gaining access.

---

## Impact

Successful exploitation resulted in full administrative (root) access to the target system. This demonstrates the severe security risk posed by exposed vulnerable services.

---

## Lessons Learned
- Importance of patch management
- Risks of exposing unnecessary services
- Value of thorough enumeration before exploitation
